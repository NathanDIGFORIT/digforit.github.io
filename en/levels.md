**SCC Mining**<br>
On the platform you can obtain SCC by our mining system. When you place a bet on the platform you get a certain amount of SCC based on the level you are. The total SCC you get per bet of DIG is :

TOTAL_SCC = BET_DIG * PLAYER_LEVEL_MINING_RATIO*GAME_FACTOR

**Example:**<br>
You are in level GOLD and you place a bet of 10 DIG, then you get 10 * 1 * 1 = 10 µSCC<br>
Note : 1 µSCC = 0.000001<br>
Game factor is for LUCKY DIG always 1<br>
